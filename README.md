<h1>Hello, I'm Luca! </h1>
<h2>Data Analyst, Programmer</h2>

Originally from Udine, Italy, I moved to the United States to play Division I College Soccer while attaining my BS in Computer Science with a Minor in Business Administration at the University of South Carolina Upstate.
After that I moved to New York to pursue a Master‚Äôs Degree with a concentration in Business Analytics at Marist College. I am proficient in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. Feel free to explore my projects below!
As a STEM graduate, I plan to take advantage of my OPT authorization to work for the next 3 years in the US.
I am fully fluent in English and Italian, and I am currently based in Spartanburg, SC.
